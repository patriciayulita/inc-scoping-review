AB  - Background: Evaluating pain in neonates is a considerably difficult task, given the fact that pain is merely a subjective phenomenon. This study aimed at assessing the effects of pain on the EEG picture of neonates, and whether or not, sucrose administration can alleviate pain associated with invasive neonatal procedures. Method(s): The EEG recordings of a cohort of 21 neonates, who didn't exhibit any manifestations of neurological deficits, were prospectively analyzed. Postnatal age ranged between 3 and 27 days, with a mean of 14.05+/-7.32 days. EEG recording, vital data and Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) scoring were performed before and following painful stimulation via heel stick blood sampling during routine blood glucose measurements via glucometer, during non-nutritive suckling (NNS) and during suckling of sucrose. Result(s): Analysis of obtained data revealed Significant rise in heart rate, lower oxygen saturation following nociceptive stimuli (without soothing (p=0.0007 & p=0.016 respectively). Suckling of sucrose was associated with a significantly lower heart rate than stimulation without soothing (p=0.015). A significantly higher NIPS score during heel lancing, without soothing (median score = 6) as opposed to during heel lancing with NNS, and while suckling sucrose (p=0.000). EEG wave's frequency of alpha waves at electrode position F3 was significantly higher, following induction of pain while suckling sucrose (p<0.05). The Results yielded a significant correlation between random blood sugar levels and the frequency of both of alpha and beta EEG waves following induction of pain, without soothing (r=0.529, -0.589 respectively and p=0.014, 0.005 respectively). Moreover, Results also concluded that there is a significant positive relationship between heart rate and the frequency of beta waves at electrode position F4 following induction of pain, without soothing (r = -0.452 and p=0.039). A significant correlation between oxygen saturation levels and the frequency of delta EEG waves at electrode position F4 was noted following induction of pain with NNS (r = -0.478 and p=0.028). A significant correlation between heart rate and the frequency of theta EEG waves at electrode position F3 was detected (r=0.448 and p=0.042). Moreover, a significant correlation was noted between oxygen saturation levels and the pain scale score, as well as the frequency of both alpha and delta EEG waves (r = -0.492, 0.433, -0.453 respectively and p=0.023, 0.049, 0.039 respectively). Results also pointed to a significant correlation between oxygen saturation levels and NIPS score, during sucrose suckling (r = -0.492 and p=0.023). Conclusion(s): Pain triggers nociceptive brain electrical activities as evidenced by EEG changes. It was also proven that oral sucrose administration significantly affects the electrical activities of the neonatal brain's nociceptive neural circuits.

AB  - A newborn infant has an extraordinarily vulnerable and immature central nervous system, which is undergoing rapid structural and functional development. As these infants are pre-verbal and their neurological systems are immature, assessing accurately and treating effectively procedure-related pain is a significant challenge. The nociceptive signals caused by the pain are accompanied by changes in regional blood oxygenation and neuronal activity in the infant’s brain. In this study, we developed a dual-mode Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) monitor that can measure regional brain oxygenation and neuronal activity concurrently (safe and non-invasive). The neuronal activity is measured by an innovative low-noise EEG amplifier in both conventional and ultra-low frequency bandwidths. This multimodal recording allows us to investigate the coupling of neuronal activity and the neurovascular system as never before. NIRS and EEG electrodes are miniaturized and unified in one sensor. This modification facilitates the use of a NIRS/EEG device for recording from neonatal subjects. Ten infants, born between 27-35 weeks gestational age, are being recruited from the NICU at BCWH. They are monitored during a single, routine blood draw required for clinical care. In this experiment, we investigate the change of cerebral hemodynamic across 3 phases of blood collection, baseline, heel lance, recovery. Variation of blood flow accompanied with the slow shift of EEG has been detected during the pain stimulus phase. Additionally, the increase of gamma-band correlated to a rise in blood flow is also observed. © 2021 SPIE.

AB  - AIMS: The objective of this study was to compare the influence of breastfeeding and 24% oral sucrose on pain-related electrophysiologic activity, bio-behavioural pain scores, physiologic recovery, and adverse events during heel lance., STUDY DESIGN: Single-blind randomized controlled trial., SUBJECTS: 39 full-term infants were randomized to receive breastfeeding or 0.24 mL of 24% oral sucrose plus offered non-nutritive sucking 2 min prior to heel lance., OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome of pain-related potential was recorded on electroencephalogram. Secondary outcomes included Premature Infant Pain Profile - Revised (PIPP-R) score, physiologic recovery, and adverse events. Data were analyzed per protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03272594)., RESULTS: Between November 2017 and January 2019, 20 infants were randomized to breastfeeding and 19 infants to receive oral sucrose. Infants who were breastfeeding had an appreciably smaller, yet not statistically different (F[1,15.9] = 0.58, p = 0.64, SE = 11.79), amplitude pain-related potential (peak amplitude 0.29 muV) following heel lance compared to infants who received oral sucrose (peak amplitude 8.97 muV). Mean PIPP-R scores were not statistically significantly different between groups following heel lance, however, they were indicative of low pain across groups. Mean time in seconds to physiologic recovery was faster in breastfeeding infants (M = 17.5, SD = 31.1) compared to oral sucrose (M = 70.8, SD = 144.3). There were no safety concerns., DISCUSSION: Breastfeeding and oral sucrose both reduce bio-behavioural responses to pain, however, may differentially modulate pain response in the infant brain. Further research to understand the neurophysiologic effects of these interventions during acute painful procedures is needed. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - ABSTRACT: In neonates, a noxious stimulus elicits pain-related facial expression changes and distinct brain activity as measured by electroencephalography, but past research has revealed an inconsistent relationship between these responses. Facial activity is the most commonly used index of neonatal pain in clinical settings, with clinical thresholds determining if analgesia should be provided; however, we do not know if these thresholds are associated with differences in how the neonatal brain processes a noxious stimulus. The objective of this study was to examine whether subclinical vs clinically significant levels of pain-related facial activity are related to differences in the pattern of nociceptive brain activity in preterm and term neonates. We recorded whole-head electroencephalography and video in 78 neonates (0-14 days postnatal age) after a clinically required heel lance. Using an optimal constellation of Neonatal Facial Coding System actions (brow bulge, eye squeeze, and nasolabial furrow), we compared the serial network engagement (microstates) between neonates with and without clinically significant pain behaviour. Results revealed a sequence of nociceptive cortical network activation that was independent of pain-related behavior; however, a separate but interleaved sequence of early activity was related to the magnitude of the immediate behavioural response. Importantly, the degree of pain-related behavior is related to how the brain processes a stimulus and not simply the degree of cortical activation. This suggests that neonates who exhibit clinically significant pain behaviours process the stimulus differently and that neonatal pain-related behaviours reflect just a portion of the overall cortical pain response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Strong evidence suggests that maternal-infant skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is effective in reducing behavioural responses to pain. Given the multi-sensory benefits of SSC, it is highly likely that SSC provided during pain in early life may reduce pain-induced brain activity. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of SSC compared to 24% sucrose on pain-induced activity in the preterm infant brain during a medically required heel lance. Secondary objectives include determining (a) differences between behavioural pain response and noxious-related brain activity during heel lance and (b) rate of adverse events across groups., METHODS: We will randomly assign 126 babies (32 to 36 completed weeks gestational age) admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit, and their mothers within the first seven days of age to receive (i) SSC plus sterile water and (ii) 24% oral sucrose. Each baby will receive a medically indicated heel lance, following a no treatment baseline period. The primary outcome is noxious-related brain activity measured using an electroencephalogram (EEG) pain-specific event-related potential. Secondary outcomes include pain intensity measured using a bio-behavioural infant pain assessment tool (Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised) and rate of adverse events., DISCUSSION: This will be the first clinical trial to compare the effect of SSC and 24% sucrose on pain-induced brain activity in the preterm infant brain during a clinical noxious stimulus, measured using EEG. Given the negative neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with unmanaged pain, it is imperative that preterm babies receive the most effective pain-reducing treatments to improve their health outcomes. Our findings will have important implications in informing optimal pain assessment and management in preterm infants., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03745963 .

AB  - Introduction The substantial compression of the dural sac and the subsequent cranial shift of cerebrospinal fluid caused by a high-volume caudal block has been shown to significantly but transiently reduce cerebral blood flow. The aim of the present study was to determine whether this reduction in cerebral perfusion is significant enough to alter brain function, as assessed by electroencephalography (EEG).

Methods Following ethics approval and parental informed consent, 11 infants (0–3 months) scheduled to undergo inguinal hernia repair were included in the study. EEG electrodes (using nine electrodes according to the 10–20 standard) were applied following anesthesia induction. Following a 5 min baseline period, a caudal block was performed (1.5 mL/kg), whereafter the EEG, hemodynamic, and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy responses were followed during a 20 min observation period that was divided into four 5 min segments. Special attention was given to alterations in delta power activity since this may indicate cerebral ischemia.

Results All 11 infants displayed transient EEG changes, mainly represented by increased relative delta power, during the initial 5–10 min postinjection. The observed changes had returned close to baseline values 15 min postinjection. Heart rate and blood pressure remained stable throughout the study.

Conclusion A high-volume caudal block appears to increase intracranial pressure, thereby reducing cerebral blood flow, to the extent that it transiently will affect cerebral function as assessed by EEG (increased delta power activity) in approximately 90% of small infants.

AB  - Despite the high burden of pain experienced by hospitalised neonates, there are few analgesics with proven efficacy. Testing analgesics in neonates is experimentally and ethically challenging and minimising the number of neonates required to demonstrate efficacy is essential. EEG (electroencephalography)-derived measures of noxious-evoked brain activity can be used to assess analgesic efficacy; however, as variability exists in neonate's responses to painful procedures, large sample sizes are often required. Here, we present an experimental paradigm to account for individual differences in noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity which can be used to improve the design of analgesic trials in neonates. The paradigm is developed and tested across four observational studies using clinical, experimental, and simulated data (92 neonates). We provide evidence of the efficacy of gentle brushing and paracetamol, substantiating the need for randomised controlled trials of these interventions. This work provides an important step towards safe, cost-effective clinical trials of analgesics in neonates. Copyright © 2021, Cobo et al.

AB  - Immune function and sensitivity to pain are closely related, but the association between early life inflammation and sensory nervous system development is poorly understood-especially in humans. Here, in term-born infants, we measure brain activity and reflex withdrawal activity (using EEG and EMG) and behavioural and physiological activity (using the PIPP-R score) to assess the impact of suspected early-onset neonatal infection on tactile- and noxious-evoked responses. We present evidence that neonatal inflammation (assessed by measuring C-reactive protein levels) is associated with increased spinal cord excitability and evoked brain activity following both tactile and noxious stimulation. There are early indications that this hyperalgesia could be maintained post-inflammation, supporting pre-clinical reports of early-life immune dysfunction influencing pain sensitivity in adults.

Noxious stimulation of infants 35 39 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), evokes specific cortical neuronal activity at the vertex (nERP). However the infant cortex undergoes significant structural and functional changes between 28 and 46 weeks PMA and this may affect processing of noxious stimulation at a cortical level. Method(s): nERP was defined from EEG epochs (n = 23) recorded following noxious heel lances at electrodes CPz of 18 term infants (37 46-week PMA) using Principal Component (PC) Analysis. The weights of the defined nERP were calculated in equivalent EEG epochs (n = 63) at 16 electrode positions from 44 infants (28 46-week). The influence of PMA on the weight of the nERP was then assessed with a linear regression. This was compared to the influence of the PMA on the occurrence of deltabrushes in the same EEG epochs. Delta-brushes (a distinctive EEG pattern of premature infants normally evoked by sensory stimulation) were identified adopting wavelet time-frequency analysis. Result(s): nERP consisting of a positive deflection at 460 ms poststimulation was identified (1-way ANOVA, p = 1.7x10-5). The associated PC weights had a significant increasing linear trend with respect to PMA at CPz/Cz (0.008 and 0.006 week-1; p< 0.05). Delta-brushes were evoked following noxious stimulation in all the youngest and in only 20% of the oldest infants. Conclusion(s): The nociceptive specific component increases with PMA. Our results are consistent with a less-specialized response to noxious stimulation in the younger infants, possibly reflecting a relatively immature organization of the functional neuronal networks of the cortex.

AB  - When and how infants begin to discriminate noxious from innocuous stimuli is a fundamental question in neuroscience [1]. However, little is known about the development of the necessary cortical somatosensory functional prerequisites in the intact human brain. Recent studies of developing brain networks have emphasized the importance of transient spontaneous and evoked neuronal bursting activity in the formation of functional circuits [2, 3]. These neuronal bursts are present during development and precede the onset of sensory functions [4, 5]. Their disappearance and the emergence of more adult-like activity are therefore thought to signal the maturation of functional brain circuitry [2, 4]. Here we show the changing patterns of neuronal activity that underlie the onset of nociception and touch discrimination in the preterm infant. We have conducted noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG) recording of the brain neuronal activity in response to time-locked touches and clinically essential noxious lances of the heel in infants aged 28-45 weeks gestation. We show a transition in brain response following tactile and noxious stimulation from nonspecific, evenly dispersed neuronal bursts to modality-specific, localized, evoked potentials. The results suggest that specific neural circuits necessary for discrimination between touch and nociception emerge from 35-37 weeks gestation in the human brain. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience. Since infants cannot verbally report their experiences, current methods of pain assessment are based on behavioural and physiological body reactions, such as crying, body movements or changes in facial expression. While these measures demonstrate that infants mount a response following noxious stimulation, they are limited: they are based on activation of subcortical somatic and autonomic motor pathways that may not be reliably linked to central sensory processing in the brain. Knowledge of how the central nervous system responds to noxious events could provide an insight to how nociceptive information and pain is processed in newborns. The heel lancing procedure used to extract blood from hospitalised infants offers a unique opportunity to study pain in infancy. In this video we describe how electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) time-locked to this procedure can be used to investigate nociceptive activity in the brain and spinal cord. This integrative approach to the measurement of infant pain has the potential to pave the way for an effective and sensitive clinical measurement tool.

AB  - Newborn human infants display robust pain behaviour and specific cortical activity following noxious skin stimulation, but it is not known whether brain processing of nociceptive information differs in infants and adults. Imaging studies have emphasised the overlap between infant and adult brain connectome architecture, but electrophysiological analysis of infant brain nociceptive networks can provide further understanding of the functional postnatal development of pain perception. Here we hypothesise that the human infant brain encodes noxious information with different neuronal patterns compared to adults. To test this we compared EEG responses to the same time-locked noxious skin lance in infants aged 0-19 days (n = 18, clinically required) and adults aged 23-48 years (n = 21). Time-frequency analysis revealed that while some features of adult nociceptive network activity are present in infants at longer latencies, including beta-gamma oscillations, infants display a distinct, long latency, noxious evoked 18-fold energy increase in the fast delta band (2-4 Hz) that is absent in adults. The differences in activity between infants and adults have a widespread topographic distribution across the brain. These data support our hypothesis and indicate important postnatal changes in the encoding of mechanical pain in the human brain.

AB  - Changes in facial expression are an essential form of social communication and in nonverbal infants are often used to alert care providers to pain-related distress. However, studies of early human brain development suggest that premature infants aged less than 34 weeks' gestation do not display discriminative brain activity patterns to equally salient noxious and innocuous events. Here we examine the development of facial expression in 105 infants, aged between 28 and 42 weeks' gestation. We show that the presence of facial expression change after noxious and innocuous stimulation is age-dependent and that discriminative facial expressions emerge from approximately 33 weeks' gestation. In a subset of 49 infants, we also recorded EEG brain activity and demonstrated that the temporal emergence of facial discrimination mirrors the developmental profile of the brain's ability to generate discriminative responses. Furthermore, within individual infants, the ability to display discriminative facial expressions is significantly related to brain response maturity. These data demonstrate that the emergence of behavioural discrimination in early human life corresponds to our brain's ability to discriminate noxious and innocuous events and raises fundamental questions as to how best to interpret infant behaviours when measuring and treating pain in premature infants.

AB  - A subclass of C fibre sensory neurons found in hairy skin are activated by gentle touch [1] and respond optimally to stroking at ~1-10 cm/s, serving a protective function by promoting affiliative behaviours. In adult humans, stimulation of these C-tactile (CT) afferents is pleasant, and can reduce pain perception [2]. Touch-based techniques, such as infant massage and kangaroo care, are designed to comfort infants during procedures, and a modest reduction in pain-related behavioural and physiological responses has been observed in some studies [3]. Here, we investigated whether touch can reduce noxious-evoked brain activity. We demonstrate that stroking (at 3 cm/s) prior to an experimental noxious stimulus or clinical heel lance can attenuate noxious-evoked brain activity in infants. CT fibres may represent a biological target for non-pharmacological interventions that modulate pain in early life. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Measuring infant pain is complicated by their inability to describe the experience. While nociceptive brain activity, reflex withdrawal and facial grimacing have been characterised, the relationship between these activity patterns has not been examined. As cortical and spinally mediated activity is developmentally regulated, it cannot be assumed that they are predictive of one another in the immature nervous system. Here, using a new experimental paradigm, we characterise the nociceptive-specific brain activity, spinal reflex withdrawal and behavioural activity following graded intensity noxious stimulation and clinical heel lancing in 30 term infants. We show that nociceptive-specific brain activity and nociceptive reflex withdrawal are graded with stimulus intensity (p < 0.001), significantly correlated (r = 0.53, p = 0.001) and elicited at an intensity that does not evoke changes in clinical pain scores (p = 0.55). The strong correlation between reflex withdrawal and nociceptive brain activity suggests that movement of the limb away from a noxious stimulus is a sensitive indication of nociceptive brain activity in term infants. This could underpin the development of new clinical pain assessment measures.

AB  - In adults, nociceptive reflexes and behavioral responses are modulated by a network of brain regions via descending projections to the spinal dorsal horn [1]. Coordinated responses to noxious inputs manifest from a balance of descending facilitation and inhibition. In contrast, young infants display exaggerated and uncoordinated limb reflexes [2]. Our understanding of nociceptive processing in the infant brain has been advanced by the use of electrophysiological and hemodynamic imaging [3-6]. From approximately 35 weeks' gestation, nociceptive-specific patterns of brain activity emerge [7], whereas prior to this, non-specific bursts of activity occur in response to noxious, tactile, visual, and auditory stimulation [7-10]. During the preterm period, refinement of spinal cord excitability is also observed: reflex duration shortens, response threshold increases, and improved discrimination between tactile and noxious events occurs [2, 11, 12]. However, the development of descending modulation in human infants remains relatively unexplored. In 40 infants aged 28-42 weeks' gestation, we examined the relationship between nociceptive brain activity and spinal reflex withdrawal activity in response to a clinically essential noxious procedure. Nociceptive-specific brain activity increases in magnitude with gestational age, whereas reflex withdrawal activity decreases in magnitude, duration, and latency across the same developmental period. By recording brain and spinal cord activity in the same infants, we demonstrate that the maturation of nociceptive brain activity is concomitant with the refinement of noxious-evoked limb reflexes. We postulate that, consistent with studies in animals, infant reflexes are influenced by the development of top-down inhibitory modulation from maturing subcortical and cortical brain networks.

AB  - Pain in infants is undertreated and poorly understood, representing a major clinical problem. In part, this is due to our inability to objectively measure pain in nonverbal populations. We present and validate an electroencephalography-based measure of infant nociceptive brain activity that is evoked by acute noxious stimulation and is sensitive to analgesic modulation. This measure should be valuable both for mechanistic investigations and for testing analgesic efficacy in the infant population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infant pain has immediate and long-term effects but is undertreated because of a paucity of evidence-based analgesics. Although morphine is often used to sedate ventilated infants, its analgesic efficacy is unclear. We aimed to establish whether oral morphine could provide effective and safe analgesia in non-ventilated premature infants for acute procedural pain., METHODS: In this single-centre masked trial, 31 infants at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK, were randomly allocated using a web-based facility with a minimisation algorithm to either 100 mug/kg oral morphine sulphate or placebo 1 h before a clinically required heel lance and retinopathy of prematurity screening examination, on the same occasion. Eligible infants were born prematurely at less than 32 weeks' gestation or with a birthweight lower than 1501 g and had a gestational age of 34-42 weeks at the time of the study. The co-primary outcome measures were the Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised (PIPP-R) score after retinopathy of prematurity screening and the magnitude of noxious-evoked brain activity after heel lancing. Secondary outcome measures assessed physiological stability and safety. This trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database (number 2014-003237-25)., FINDINGS: Between Oct 30, 2016, and Nov 17, 2017, 15 infants were randomly allocated to morphine and 16 to placebo; one infant assigned placebo was withdrawn from the study before monitoring began. The predefined stopping boundary was crossed, and trial recruitment stopped because of profound respiratory adverse effects of morphine without suggestion of analgesic efficacy. None of the co-primary outcome measures differed significantly between groups. PIPP-R score after retinopathy of prematurity screening was mean 11.1 (SD 3.2) with morphine and 10.5 (3.4) with placebo (mean difference 0.5, 95% CI -2.0 to 3.0; p=0.66). Noxious-evoked brain activity after heel lancing was median 0.99 (IQR 0.40-1.56) with morphine and 0.75 (0.33-1.22) with placebo (median difference 0.25, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.80; p=0.25)., INTERPRETATION: Administration of oral morphine (100 mug/kg) to non-ventilated premature infants has the potential for harm without analgesic efficacy. We do not recommend oral morphine for retinopathy of prematurity screening and strongly advise caution if considering its use for other acute painful procedures in non-ventilated premature infants., FUNDING: Wellcome Trust and National Institute for Health Research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Touch interventions such as massage and skin-to-skin contact relieve neonatal pain. The Parental touch trial (Petal) aimed to assess whether parental stroking of their baby before a clinically required heel lance, at a speed of approximately 3 cm/s to optimally activate C-tactile nerve fibres, provides effective pain relief., METHODS: Petal is a multicentre, randomised, parallel-group interventional superiority trial conducted in the John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK) and the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital (Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Exeter, UK). Neonates without neurological abnormalities who were born at 35 weeks gestational age or more and required a blood test via a heel lance in the first week of life were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive parental touch for 10 s either before (intervention group) or after (control group) the clinically required heel lance. Randomisation was managed at the Oxford site using a web-based minimisation algorithm with allocation concealment. The primary outcome measure was the magnitude of noxious-evoked brain activity in response to the heel lance measured with electroencephalography (EEG). Secondary outcome measures were Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised (PIPP-R) score, development of tachycardia, and parental anxiety score. For all outcomes, the per-protocol effect was estimated via complier average causal effect analysis on the full analysis set. The trial is registered on ISRCTN (ISRCTN14135962) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04901611)., FINDINGS: Between Sept 1, 2021, and Feb 7, 2023, 159 parents were approached to participate in the study, and 112 neonates were included. 56 neonates were randomly assigned to the intervention group of parental stroking before the heel lance and 56 to the control group of parental stroking after the heel lance. The mean of the magnitude of the heel lance-evoked brain activity was 0.85 arbitrary units (a.u.; SD 0.70; n=39; a scaled magnitude of 1 a.u. represents the expected mean response to a heel lance in term-aged neonates) in the intervention group and 0.91 a.u. (SD 0.76; n=43) in the control group. Therefore, the primary outcome did not differ significantly between groups, with a mean difference of -0.11 a.u. (lower in intervention group; SD 0.77; 95% CI -0.42 to 0.20; p=0.38; n=82). No significant difference was observed across secondary outcomes. The PIPP-R difference in means was 1.10 (higher in intervention group, 95% CI -0.42 to 2.61; p=0.15; n=100); the odds ratio of becoming tachycardic was 2.08 (95% CI 0.46 to 9.46; p=0.34, n=105) in the intervention group with reference to the control group; and the difference in parental State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State score was -0.44 (higher in control group; SD 6.85; 95% CI -2.91 to 2.02; p=0.72; n=106). One serious adverse event (desaturation) occurred in a neonate randomly assigned to the control group, which was not considered to be related to the study., INTERPRETATION: Parental stroking delivered at an optimal speed to activate C-tactile fibres for a duration of 10 s before the painful procedure did not significantly change neonates' magnitude of pain-related brain activity, PIPP-R score, or development of tachycardia. The trial highlighted the challenge of translating an experimental researcher-led tactile intervention into a parent-led approach, and the value of involving parents in their baby's pain management., FUNDING: Wellcome Trust and Bliss.

AB  - Newborn infants display strong nociceptive behavior in response to tissue damaging stimuli, and this is accompanied by nociceptive activity generated in subcortical and cortical areas of the brain [1, 2]. In the absence of verbal report, these nociceptive responses are used as measures of pain sensation in newborn humans, as they are in animals [3, 4]. However, many infants are raised in a physiologically stressful environment, and little is known about the effect of background levels of stress upon their pain responses. In adults, acute physiological stress causes hyperalgesia [5-7], and increased background stress increases pain [8-10], but these data cannot necessarily be extrapolated to infants. Here we have simultaneously measured nociceptive behavior, brain activity, and levels of physiological stress in a sample of 56 newborn human infants aged 36-42 weeks. Salivary cortisol (hypothalamic pituitary axis), heart rate variability (sympathetic adrenal medullary system), EEG event-related potentials (nociceptive cortical activity), and facial expression (behavior) were acquired in individual infants following a clinically required heel lance. We show that infants with higher levels of stress exhibit larger amplitude cortical nociceptive responses, but this is not reflected in their behavior. Furthermore, while nociceptive behavior and cortical activity are normally correlated, this relationship is disrupted in infants with high levels of physiological stress. Brain activity evoked by noxious stimulation is therefore enhanced by stress, but this cannot be deduced from observation of pain behavior. This may be important in the prevention of adverse effects of early repetitive pain on brain development. Copyright © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a dataset of cortical, behavioural, and physiological responses following a single, clinically required noxious stimulus in a neonatal sample. Cortical activity was recorded from 112 neonates (29-47 weeks gestational age at study) using a 20-channel electroencephalogram (EEG), which was time-locked to a heel lance. This data is linked to pain-related behaviour (facial expression), physiology (heart rate, oxygenation) and a composite clinical score (Premature Infant Pain Profile, PIPP). The dataset includes responses to non-noxious sham and auditory controls. The infants' relevant medical and pain history was collected up to the day of the study and recorded in an extensive database of variables including clinical condition at birth, diagnoses, medications, previous painful procedures, injuries, and selected maternal information. This dataset can be used to investigate the cortical, physiological, and behavioural pain-related processing in human infants and to evaluate the impact of medical conditions and experiences upon the infant response to noxious stimuli. Furthermore, it provides information on the formation of individual pain phenotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonates display strong behavioural, physiological and cortical responses to tissue-damaging procedures. Parental contact can successfully regulate general behavioural and physiological reactivity of the infant, but it is not known whether it can influence noxious-related activity in the brain. Brain activity is highly dependent upon maternal presence in animal models, and therefore this could be an important contextual factor in human infant pain-related brain activity., METHODS: Global topographic analysis was used to identify the presence and inter-group differences in noxious-related activity in three separate parental contexts. EEG was recorded during a clinically required heel lance in three age and sex-matched groups of neonates (a) while held by a parent in skin-to-skin (n = 9), (b) while held by a parent with clothing (n = 9) or (c) not held at all, but in individualized care (n = 9)., RESULTS: The lance elicited a sequence of 4-5 event-related potentials (ERPs), including the noxious ERP (nERP), which was smallest for infants held skin-to-skin and largest for infants held with clothing (p=0.016). The nERP was then followed by additional and divergent long-latency ERPs (> 750 ms post-lance), not previously described, in each of the groups, suggesting the engagement of different higher level cortical processes depending on parental contact., CONCLUSIONS: These results show the importance of considering contextual factors in determining infant brain activity and reveal the powerful influence of parental contact upon noxious-related activity across the developing human brain., SIGNIFICANCE: This observational study found that the way in which the neonatal brain processes a noxious stimulus is altered by the type of contact the infant has with their mother. Specifically, being held in skin-to-skin reduces the magnitude of noxious-related cortical activity. This work has also shown that different neural mechanisms are engaged depending on the mother/infant context, suggesting maternal contact can change how a baby's brain processes a noxious stimulus.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Preterm infants undergo frequent painful procedures in the neonatal intensive care unit. Electroencephalography (EEG) changes in reaction to invasive procedures have been reported in preterm and full-term neonates. Frontal EEG asymmetry as an index of emotion during tactile stimulation shows inconsistent findings in full-term infants, and has not been examined in the context of pain in preterm infants. Our aim was to examine whether heel lance for blood collection induces changes in right-left frontal asymmetry, suggesting negative emotional response, in preterm neonates at different gestational age (GA) at birth and different duration of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three groups of preterm infants were compared: set 1: group 1 (n=24), born and tested at 28 weeks GA; group 2 (n=22), born at 28 weeks GA and tested at 33 weeks; set 2: group 3 (n=25), born and tested at 33 weeks GA. EEG power was calculated for 30-second artifact-free periods, in standard frequency bandwidths, in 3 phases (baseline, up to 5 min after heel lance, 10 min after heel lance)., RESULTS: No significant differences were found in right-left frontal asymmetry, or in ipsilateral or contralateral somatosensory response, across phases. In contrast, the Behavioral Indicators of Infant Pain scores changed across phase (P<0.0001). Infants in group 1 showed lower Behavioral Indicators of Infant Pain scores (P=0.039)., DISCUSSION: There are technical challenges in recording EEG during procedures, as pain induces motor movements. More research is needed to determine the most sensitive approach to measure EEG signals within the context of pain in infancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Newborns requiring hospitalisation frequently undergo painful procedures. Prevention of pain in infants is of prime concern because of adverse associations with physiological and neurological development. However, pain mitigation is currently guided by behavioural observation assessments that have not been validated against direct evidence of pain processing in the brain. The aim of this study was to determine whether cry presence or amplitude is a valid indicator of pain processing in newborns., DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort., SETTING: Newborn nursery., PATIENTS: Healthy infants born at >37 weeks and <42 weeks gestation., INTERVENTIONS: We prospectively studied newborn cortical responses to light touch, cold and heel stick, and the amplitude of associated infant vocalisations using our previously published paradigms of time-locked electroencephalogram (EEG) with simultaneous audio recordings., RESULTS: Latencies of cortical peak responses to each of the three stimuli type were significantly different from each other. Of 54 infants, 13 (24%), 19 (35%) and 35 (65%) had cries in response to light touch, cold and heel stick, respectively. Cry in response to non-painful stimuli did not predict cry in response to heel stick. All infants with EEG data had measurable pain responses to heel stick, whether they cried or not. There was no association between presence or amplitude of cries and cortical nociceptive amplitudes., CONCLUSIONS: In newborns with distinct brain responses to light touch, cold and pain, cry presence or amplitude characteristics do not provide adequate behavioural markers of pain signalling in the brain. New bedside assessments of newborn pain may need to be developed using brain-based methodologies as benchmarks in order to provide optimal pain mitigation.

AB  - The current study aimed to characterize changes in EEG-related measures after noxious stimuli in neonates and to assess their potential utility as measures of pain and/or discomfort during neonatal intensive care. Seventy-two healthy term infants were investigated: Twenty-eight had a non-skin-breaking pin-prick on the heel, randomized to receive either oral glucose (n = 16) or water (n = 12) before the stimulus. Twenty-one infants were studied during a venous blood sample from the dorsum of the hand, 23 infants during a capillary heel stick. Behavioral pain responses were assessed with the Premature Infant Pain Profile Scale. The stimulus evoked a significant increase in higher frequency components (10-30 Hz) which also correlated to behavioral measures. The frontotemporal localization of the increased activity with frequency bands similar to electromuscular artifacts and the relation to behavioral measures confirmed that this activity corresponds to an increase in muscle tone. There was no change in frontal EEG asymmetry in any of the groups. The present results indicate that responses in cortical activity recorded by EEG are not useful for clinical assessment of infants' responses to noxious stimuli.

AB  - Background: Music therapy may be beneficial for relieving pain associated with Neonatal Intensive Care Unit procedures. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of music on the EEG and HRV of premature infants during painful procedures. Method(s): This was a randomised crossover study in newborns delivered before 32weeks gestational age (GA). Infants were randomised to receive initially either sucrose or sucrose and music therapy (Brahms' lullaby) during routine venepuncture. Infants had multichannel EEG recorded during the procedure, with ECG part of the EEG montage. Three 2-minute artefact free EEG and ECG epochs (before venepuncture, 4 minutes and 18 minutes after venepuncture) were selected for analysis. Matlab was used to perform quantitative EEG and HRV analysis. Results Twenty-one preterm infants were recruited 8 males (38%) and 13 females (62%), mean birth weight 932 g. The EEG analysis showed no clinically significant difference between the two groups. The HRV analysis showed an increase of the mean NN interval and LF-HF ratio at 18 minutes post-procedure in intervention arm. Conclusion(s): EEG features were not significantly altered by painful procedures in our study, and music therapy did not change this response. The changes in HRV indicate improved autonomic stability and a decrease stress during painful procedures with music therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a non-noxious vibratory stimulus on noxious-evoked cortical responses to skin puncture and to determine whether the presence of certain behavioural components may be used to predict such cortical responses., DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial., SETTING: Level IV neonatal intensive care unit at a stand-alone children's hospital., PATIENTS: 134 hospitalised infants between 36 and 52 weeks' postmenstrual age and ordered to receive a clinically required laboratory draw., INTERVENTIONS: Infants randomised to receive the intervention, a vibratory stimulus at the site of skin puncture beginning 10 s prior to a heel stick, or the control, no vibration., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Electroencephalography and video recording time-locked to the deployment of the lancet for the skin puncture. Noxious-evoked cortical responses were measured by the area under the curve in the somatosensory region contralateral to the skin puncture. Behavioural responses were coded through video analysis., RESULTS: Noxious-evoked cortical responses were significantly reduced in participants receiving the vibratory stimulus compared with the control (frontal, p<0.0001; central, p=0.0088; central-parietal, p=0.0111). There were no significant differences in behavioural responses between groups (all p>0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: A non-noxious vibratory stimulus presented prior to and continuing simultaneously with skin puncture significantly mitigates nociception in hospitalised infants. The presence or absence of facial expression components is inadequate to reliably predict pain signalling in the brain., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04050384.

AB  - Habituation to recurrent non-threatening or unavoidable noxious stimuli is an important aspect of adaptation to pain. Neonates, especially if preterm, are exposed to repeated noxious procedures during their clinical care. They can mount strong behavioral, autonomic, spinal, and cortical responses to a single noxious stimulus; however, it is not known whether the developing nervous system can adapt to the recurrence of these inputs. Here, we used electroencephalography to investigate changes in cortical microstates (representing the complex sequential processing of noxious inputs) following two consecutive clinically required heel lances in term and preterm infants. We show that stimulus repetition dampens the engagement of initial microstates and associated behavioral and autonomic responses in term infants, while preterm infants do not show signs of habituation. Nevertheless, both groups engage different longer-latency cortical microstates to each lance, which is likely to reflect changes in higher-level stimulus processing with repeated stimulation. These data suggest that while both age groups are capable of encoding contextual differences in pain, the preterm brain does not regulate the initial cortical, behavioral, and autonomic responses to repeated noxious stimuli. Habituation mechanisms to pain are already in place at term age but mature over the equivalent of the last trimester of gestation and are not fully functional in preterm neonates.

AB  - Prematurity can result in widespread neurodevelopmental impairment, with the impact of premature extrauterine exposure on brain function detectable in infancy. A range of neurodynamic and haemodynamic functional brain measures have previously been employed to study the neurodevelopmental impact of prematurity, with methodological and analytical heterogeneity across studies obscuring how multiple sensory systems are affected. Here, we outline a standardised template analysis approach to measure evoked response magnitudes for visual, tactile, and noxious stimulation in individual infants (n = 15) using EEG. By applying these templates longitudinally to an independent cohort of very preterm infants (n = 10), we observe that the evoked response template magnitudes are significantly associated with age-related maturation. Finally, in a cross-sectional study we show that the visual and tactile response template magnitudes differ between a cohort of infants who are age-matched at the time of study but who differ according to whether they are born during the very preterm or late preterm period (n = 10 and 8 respectively). These findings demonstrate the significant impact of premature extrauterine exposure on brain function and suggest that prematurity can accelerate maturation of the visual and tactile sensory system in infants born very prematurely. This study highlights the value of using a standardised multi-modal evoked-activity analysis approach to assess premature neurodevelopment, and will likely complement resting-state EEG and behavioural assessments in the study of the functional impact of developmental care interventions.

AB  - While human infants can display distinctive behavioural and physiological spinal cord and brainstem responses to noxious stimulation, it is not known whether cortical neurons are specifically activated by noxious stimuli in newborns. Here, using a novel approach to time-lock an EEG recording to a clinically required heel lance, we show the presence of a distinct nociceptive-specific potential in newborn infants (35-39 weeks postmenstrual age). The potential can be observed in single trials in the central electrodes (Cz and CPz) and using principal component analysis is characterised by a positivity that occurs at approximately 560 ms post-stimulus (N420-P560; P, positive; N, negative). The magnitude of the nociceptive-specific potential is not dependent on sleep state, whereas an earlier potential (N150-P260-N430), which is sleep-state dependent, is evoked by both noxious and non-noxious stimulation. These results provide the first direct evidence of specific noxious-evoked neural activity in the infant brain and suggest that newborn infants are capable of the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain experience.

AB  - This study demonstrates that infants who are born prematurely and who have experienced at least 40days of intensive or special care have increased brain neuronal responses to noxious stimuli compared to healthy newborns at the same postmenstrual age. We have measured evoked potentials generated by noxious clinically-essential heel lances in infants born at term (8 infants; born 37-40weeks) and in infants born prematurely (7 infants; born 24-32weeks) who had reached the same postmenstrual age (mean age at time of heel lance 39.2+/-1.2weeks). These noxious-evoked potentials are clearly distinguishable from shorter latency potentials evoked by non-noxious tactile sensory stimulation. While the shorter latency touch potentials are not dependent on the age of the infant at birth, the noxious-evoked potentials are significantly larger in prematurely-born infants. This enhancement is not associated with specific brain lesions but reflects a functional change in pain processing in the brain that is likely to underlie previously reported changes in pain sensitivity in older ex-preterm children. Our ability to quantify and measure experience-dependent changes in infant cortical pain processing will allow us to develop a more rational approach to pain management in neonatal intensive care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many infants admitted to hospital undergo repeated invasive procedures. Oral sucrose is frequently given to relieve procedural pain in neonates on the basis of its effect on behavioural and physiological pain scores. We assessed whether sucrose administration reduces pain-specific brain and spinal cord activity after an acute noxious procedure in newborn infants., METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 59 newborn infants at University College Hospital (London, UK) were randomly assigned to receive 0.5 mL 24% sucrose solution or 0.5 mL sterile water 2 min before undergoing a clinically required heel lance. Randomisation was by a computer-generated randomisation code, and researchers, clinicians, participants, and parents were masked to the identity of the solutions. The primary outcome was pain-specific brain activity evoked by one time-locked heel lance, recorded with electroencephalography and identified by principal component analysis. Secondary measures were baseline behavioural and physiological measures, observational pain scores (PIPP), and spinal nociceptive reflex withdrawal activity. Data were analysed per protocol. This study is registered, number ISRCTN78390996., FINDINGS: 29 infants were assigned to receive sucrose and 30 to sterilised water; 20 and 24 infants, respectively, were included in the analysis of the primary outcome measure. Nociceptive brain activity after the noxious heel lance did not differ significantly between infants who received sucrose and those who received sterile water (sucrose: mean 0.10, 95% CI 0.04-0.16; sterile water: mean 0.08, 0.04-0.12; p=0.46). No significant difference was recorded between the sucrose and sterile water groups in the magnitude or latency of the spinal nociceptive reflex withdrawal recorded from the biceps femoris of the stimulated leg. The PIPP score was significantly lower in infants given sucrose than in those given sterile water (mean 5.8, 95% CI 3.7-7.8 vs 8.5, 7.3-9.8; p=0.02) and significantly more infants had no change in facial expression after sucrose administration (seven of 20 [35%] vs none of 24; p<0.0001)., INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that oral sucrose does not significantly affect activity in neonatal brain or spinal cord nociceptive circuits, and therefore might not be an effective analgesic drug. The ability of sucrose to reduce clinical observational scores after noxious events in newborn infants should not be interpreted as pain relief., FUNDING: Medical Research Council.

AB  - Infants in neonatal intensive care units frequently experience clinically necessary painful procedures, which elicit a range of behavioral, physiological, and neurophysiological responses. However, the measurement of pain in this population is a challenge and no gold standard exists. The aim of this study was to investigate how noxious-evoked changes in facial expression, reflex withdrawal, brain activity, heart rate, and oxygen saturation are related and to examine their accuracy in discriminating between noxious and non-noxious stimuli. In 109 infants who received a clinically required heel lance and a control non-noxious stimulus, we investigated whether combining responses across each modality, or including multiple measures from within each modality improves our ability to discriminate the noxious and non-noxious stimuli. A random forest algorithm was used to build data-driven models to discriminate between the noxious and non-noxious stimuli in a training set which were then validated in a test set of independent infants. Measures within each modality were highly correlated, while different modalities showed less association. The model combining information across all modalities had good discriminative ability (accuracy of 0.81 in identifying noxious and non-noxious stimuli), which was higher than the discriminative power of the models built from individual modalities. This demonstrates the importance of including multiple modalities in the assessment of infant pain. Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Paediatric and Neonatal Pain published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Pain assessment in preterm infants is challenging as behavioral, autonomic, and neurophysiological measures of pain are reported to be less sensitive and specific than in term infants. Understanding the pattern of preterm infants' noxious-evoked responses is vital to improve pain assessment in this group. This study investigated the discriminability and development of multimodal noxious-evoked responses in infants aged 28-40 weeks postmenstrual age. A classifier was trained to discriminate responses to a noxious heel lance from a nonnoxious control in 47 infants, using measures of facial expression, brain activity, heart rate, and limb withdrawal, and tested in two independent cohorts with a total of 98 infants. The model discriminates responses to the noxious from the nonnoxious procedure from 28 weeks onward with an overall accuracy of 0.77-0.83 and an accuracy of 0.78-0.79 in the 28-31-week group. Noxious-evoked responses have distinct developmental patterns. Heart rate responses increase in magnitude with age, while noxious-evoked brain activity undergoes three distinct developmental stages, including a previously unreported transitory stage consisting of a negative event-related potential between 30 and 33 weeks postmenstrual age. These findings demonstrate that while noxious-evoked responses change across early development, infant responses to noxious and nonnoxious stimuli are discriminable in prematurity.

AB  - Inoculation is one of the first and most common experiences of procedural pain in infancy. However, little is known about how needle puncture pain is processed by the central nervous system in children. In this study, we describe for the first time the event-related activity in the infant brain during routine inoculation using electroencephalography. Fifteen healthy term-born infants aged 1 to 2 months (n = 12) or 12 months (n = 5) were studied in an outpatient clinic. Pain behavior was scored using the Modified Behavioral Pain Scale. A distinct inoculation event-related vertex potential, consisting of 2 late negative-positive complexes, was observable in single trials after needle contact with the skin. The amplitude of both negative-positive components was significantly greater in the 12-month group. Both inoculation event-related potential amplitude and behavioral pain scores increased with age but the 2 measures were not correlated with each other. These components are the first recordings of brain activity in response to real-life needle pain in infants up to a year old. They provide new evidence of postnatal nociceptive processing and, combined with more traditional behavioral pain scores, offer a potentially more sensitive measure for testing the efficacy of analgesic protocols in this age group.

AB  - Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) have recently provided fundamental new information about how the newborn brain processes innocuous and noxious somatosensory information. However, results derived independently from these two techniques are not entirely consistent, raising questions about the relationship between hemodynamic and electrophysiological responses in the study of touch and pain processing in the newborn. To address this, we have recorded NIRS and EEG responses simultaneously for the first time in the human infant following noxious (time-locked clinically required heel lances) and innocuous tactile cutaneous stimulation in 30 newborn infants. The results show that both techniques can be used to record quantifiable and distinct innocuous and noxious evoked activity at a group level in the newborn cortex. Noxious stimulation elicits a peak hemodynamic response that is 10-fold larger than that elicited by an innocuous stimulus (HbO2: 2.0 vs 0.3 microM) and a distinct nociceptive-specific N3P3 waveform in electrophysiological recordings. However, a novel single-trial analysis revealed that hemodynamic and electrophysiological responses do not always co-occur at an individual level, although when they do (64% of noxious test occasions), they are significantly correlated in magnitude. These data show that, while hemodynamic and electrophysiological touch and pain brain activity in newborn infants are comparable in group analyses, important individual differences remain. These data indicate that integrated and multimodal brain monitoring is required to understand central touch and pain processing in the newborn.

AB  - In adults, there are differences between male and female structural and functional brain connectivity, specifically for those regions involved in pain processing. This may partly explain the observed sex differences in pain sensitivity, tolerance, and inhibitory control, and in the development of chronic pain. However, it is not known if these differences exist from birth. Cortical activity in response to a painful stimulus can be observed in the human neonatal brain, but this nociceptive activity continues to develop in the postnatal period and is qualitatively different from that of adults, partly due to the considerable cortical maturation during this time. This research aimed to investigate the effects of sex and prematurity on the magnitude and spatial distribution pattern of the long-latency nociceptive event-related potential (nERP) using electroencephalography (EEG). We measured the cortical response time-locked to a clinically required heel lance in 81 neonates born between 29 and 42 weeks gestational age (median postnatal age 4 days). The results show that heel lance results in a spatially widespread nERP response in the majority of newborns. Importantly, a widespread pattern is significantly more likely to occur in females, irrespective of gestational age at birth. This effect is not observed for the short latency somatosensory waveform in the same infants, indicating that it is selective for the nociceptive component of the response. These results suggest the early onset of a greater anatomical and functional connectivity reported in the adult female brain, and indicate the presence of pain-related sex differences from birth.

AB  - A non-invasive integrated method was developed to measure neural and behavioural responses to peripheral sensory and noxious stimulation in human infants. The introduction of a novel event-detection interface allows synchronous recording of: (i) muscle and central nervous system activity with surface electromyography (EMG), scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS); (ii) behavioural responses with video-recording and (iii) autonomic responses (heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and cardiovascular activity) with electrocardiography (ECG) and pulse oximetry. The system can detect noxious heel lance and touch stimuli with precision (33 mus and 624 mus respectively) and accuracy (523 mus and 256 mus) and has 100% sensitivity and specificity for both types of stimulation. Its ability to detect response latencies accurately was demonstrated by a shift in latency of the vertex potential of 20.7 +/- 15.7 ms (n=6 infants), following touch of the heel and of the shoulder, reflecting the distance between the two sites. This integrated system has provided reliable and reproducible measurements of responses to sensory and noxious stimulation in human infants on more than 100 test occasions.

AB  - Recording multimodal responses to sensory stimuli in infants provides an integrative approach to investigate the developing nervous system. Accurate time-locking across modalities is essential to ensure that responses are interpreted correctly, and could also improve clinical care, for example, by facilitating automatic and objective multimodal pain assessment. Here we develop and assess a system to time-lock stimuli (including clinically-required heel lances and experimental visual, auditory and tactile stimuli) to electrophysiological research recordings and data recorded directly from a hospitalised infant’s vital signs monitor. The electronic device presented here (that we have called ‘the PiNe box’) integrates a previously developed system to time-lock stimuli to electrophysiological recordings and can simultaneously time-lock the stimuli to recordings from hospital vital signs monitors with an average precision of 105 ms (standard deviation: 19 ms), which is sufficient for the analysis of changes in vital signs. Our method permits reliable and precise synchronisation of data recordings from equipment with legacy ports such as TTL (transistor-transistor logic) and RS-232, and patient-connected networkable devices, is easy to implement, flexible and inexpensive. Unlike current all-in-one systems, it enables existing hospital equipment to be easily used and could be used for patients of any age. We demonstrate the utility of the system in infants using visual and noxious (clinically-required heel lance) stimuli as representative examples.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electroencephalography (EEG) can be used in neonates to measure brain activity changes that are evoked by noxious events, such as clinically required immunisations, cannulation and heel lancing for blood tests. EEG provides an alternative approach to infer pain experience in infants compared with more commonly used behavioural and physiological pain assessments. Establishing the generalisability and construct validity of these measures will help corroborate the use of brain-derived outcomes to evaluate the efficacy of new or existing pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods to treat neonatal pain. This study aimed to test whether a measure of noxious-evoked EEG activity called the noxious neurodynamic response function (n-NRF), that was originally derived in a sample of term-aged infants at the Oxford John Radcliffe Hospital, UK, in 2017, can reliably distinguish noxious from non-noxious events in two independent datasets collected at University College London Hospital and at Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital. We aimed to reproduce three published results that use this measure to quantify noxious-evoked changes in brain activity. We used the n-NRF to quantify noxious-evoked brain activity to test (i) whether significantly larger noxious-evoked activity is recorded in response to a clinical heel lance compared to a non-noxious control heel lance procedure; (ii) whether the magnitude of the activity evoked by a noxious heel lance is equivalent in independent cohorts of infants; and (iii) whether the magnitude of the noxious-evoked brain activity increases with postmenstrual age (PMA) in premature infants up to 37 weeks PMA. Positive replication of these studies will build confidence in the use of the n-NRF as a valid and reliable pain-related outcome which could be used to evaluate analgesic efficacy in neonates. The protocol for this study was published following peer review (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/ZY9MS)., RESULTS: The n-NRF magnitude to a noxious heel lance stimulus was significantly greater than to a non-noxious control heel lance stimulus in both the UCL dataset (n = 60; mean difference .88; 95% confidence interval (CI) .64-1.13; p < .0001) and the Exeter dataset (n = 31; mean difference .31; 95% CI .02-.61; p = .02). The mean magnitude and 90% bootstrap confidence interval of the n-NRF evoked by the heel lance did not meet our pre-defined equivalence bounds of 1.0 +/- .2 in either the UCL dataset (n = 72; mean magnitude 1.33; 90% bootstrapped CI 1.18-1.52) or the Exeter dataset (n = 35; mean magnitude .92, 90% bootstrapped CI .74-1.22). The magnitude of the n-NRF to the noxious stimulus was significantly positively correlated with PMA in infants up to 37 weeks PMA (n = 65; one-sided Pearson's R, adjusted for site: .24; 95% CI .06-1.00; p = .03)., CONCLUSIONS: We have reproduced in independent datasets the findings that the n-NRF response to a noxious stimulus is significantly greater than to a non-noxious stimulus, and that the noxious-evoked EEG response increases with PMA. The pre-defined equivalence bounds for the mean magnitude of the EEG response were not met, though this might be due to either inter-site differences such as the lack of calibration of devices between sites (a true negative) or underpowering (a false negative). This reproducibility study provides robust evidence that supports the use of the n-NRF as an objective outcome for clinical trials assessing acute nociception in neonates. Use of the n-NRF in this way has the potential to transform the way analgesic efficacy studies are performed. Copyright © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and aim: First, to compare somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in preterm newborns without major brain injury studied at term equivalent age (TEA) with a term historical control group. Second, to investigate the impact of pain exposure during the first 28 days after birth on SEPs. Third, to evaluate the association between SEPs and Bayley-III at 2 years corrected age (CA). Method(s): Infants born at <32 weeks' gestational age (GA) were studied with continuous-SEPs. First, SEP differences between preterm and term infants were analyzed. Second, regression analyses were conducted to explore the association between SEPs and painful procedures, and then between SEPs and neurodevelopment. Result(s): 86 preterm infants were prospectively enrolled. Preterm infants exhibited prolonged N1 latencies, central conduction times (CCTs), lower N1-P1 amplitudes, and more recurrently abnormal SEPs compared to term infants. Higher pain exposure predicted longer N1 latency and slower CCT (all p < 0.005), adjusting for clinical risk factors. Younger GA and postmenstrual age (PMA) at SEP recording were associated with longer N1 latency and lower N1-P1 amplitude (all p < 0.005). A normal SEP at TEA positively predicted cognitive outcome at 2 years CA (p < 0.005). Conclusion(s): Pain exposure and prematurity were risk factors for altered SEP parameters at TEA. SEPs predicted cognitive outcome.Copyright © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Objective. Pain assessment in preterm infants is often based on subjective observations, which may lack objectivity and are labor-intensive. Non-invasive EEG can serve as an objective assessment tool. However, no specific EEG feature within a particular frequency band and brain region has been reported for pain detection in the objective pain assessment of preterm infants. This study quantified electroencephalography (EEG) responses to procedural pain during a puncture in preterm infants, specifically analyzing three EEG parameters. Approach. Fifty-seven EEG datasets from forty-two preterm infants were analyzed across eight EEG channels. The differences between the upper and lower margins (UM-LM) of amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), as well as the five frequency bands (low delta, high delta, theta, alpha, and beta) of frequency power and time-frequency power, were used to characterize the response of the brain to pain during specific periods: before, during, and after the puncture. Main results. The Fp1 and Fp2 exhibited the most significant differences in the UM-LM aEEG differences between before vs during (Fp1:p= 0.0060, Fp2:p= 0.0031), before vs after (p< 0.0001), and during vs after (Fp1:p= 0.0427, Fp2:p= 0.025) the puncture. The C3 and C4 responded significantly to pain during the puncture in the frequency and time-frequency power, notably the time-frequency power in the low delta, which showed the most significant differences between the periods before vs during (p< 0.0001), before vs after (p< 0.0001), and during vs after (p= 0.0002) the puncture. Significance. The central brain region responds significantly to procedural pain in preterm infants, which is prominently detected in the low delta of time-frequency power. These findings support the use of EEG application as an objective and non-invasive method to identify and detect pain in nonverbal populations, focusing on specific critical channels and frequency bands.

AB  - Objective. Automated detection of artefact in stimulus-evoked electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded in neonates will improve the reproducibility and speed of analysis in clinical research compared with manual identification of artefact. Some studies use very short, single-channel epochs of EEG data with little recorded EEG per infant-for example because the clinical vulnerability of the infants limits access for recording. Current artefact-detection methods that perform well on adult data and resting-state and multi-channel data in infants are not suitable for this application. The aim of this study was to create and test an automated method of detecting artefact in single-channel 1500 ms epochs of infant EEG. Approach. A total of 410 epochs of EEG were used, collected from 160 infants of 28-43 weeks postmenstrual age. This dataset-which was balanced to include epochs of background activity and responses to visual, auditory, tactile and noxious stimuli-was presented to seven independent raters, who independently labelled the epochs according to whether or not they were able to visually identify artefacts. The data was split into a training set (340 epochs) and an independent test set (70 epochs). A random forest model was trained to identify epochs as either artefact or not artefact. Main results. This model performs well, achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.81, which is as good as manual review of data. Accuracy was not significantly related to the infant age or type of stimulus. Significance. This method provides an objective tool for automated artefact rejection for short epoch, single-channel EEG in neonates and could increase the utility of EEG in neonates in both the clinical and research setting.

AB  - Aim: Opioids might be harmful to the developing brain and dosing accuracy is important. We aimed at investigating fentanyl effects on cortical activity in infants using computational re-analysis of bedside recorded EEG signals. Method(s): Fifteen infants born at median 26.4 gestational weeks (range 23.3-34.1), with a birth weight 740 grams (530-1420) and postnatal age 7 days (5-11) received fentanyl 0.5 or 2 mug/kg intravenously before a skin-breaking procedure or tracheal intubation, respectively. Cortical activity was continuously recorded using amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG). Analyses using three computational EEG features representing cortical synchrony and signal power, were conducted five minutes pre- and 10 minutes post the drug administration. Result(s): Visual assessment of trends displayed from the EEG metrics did not indicate systematic changes. However, the magnitude of the changes in the parietal and right hemisphere signals after the dose was significantly correlated (rho < -0.5, p < 0.05) to the EEG amplitude and frequency power level before drug administration. This effect started after 3-4 min. Conclusion(s): Fentanyl, even in small doses, may affect cortical activity in the preterm brain. The effect is robustly related to the state of cortical activity prior to drug treatment, which must be taken into account when analysing the effects of sedative drugs.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Observer-dependent infant pain scales have limitations including discontinuous assessments and the lack of healthcare professionals' availability. We hypothesized that applying agnostic machine learning approaches to neonatal electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis may reveal features of the infant response to acute pain. EEG was recorded from 30 neonates undergoing acutely painful procedures (18 males, 34.0-41.7 weeks gestation at birth). EEG recordings were randomly assigned to training (n = 20) and testing (n = 10) datasets. Functional connectivity measures were calculated for each infant before and after pain-inducing procedures. A grid search including five machine learning models was conducted on the training dataset, and each model was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. An optimal model, having the highest F-1 score, was obtained and evaluated on the independent testing dataset. A gradient boosting model with 12 features showed optimal performance, with 90% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve suggesting high specificity (0.90) and precision (0.90). The five highest ranked features corresponded to EEG electrode pairs: T7-P4, Fz-CP5, FC1-TP10, CP6-Cz, and Fz-F3, suggesting involvement of the contralateral temporal gyrus, opercular cortex, thalamus, and bilateral insula in infant pain processing. Preliminary changes in functional connectivity indicate infant pain processing. Future machine learning algorithms can integrate physiological and behavioral parameters with EEG changes to accurately assess the complexity of infant pain responses.

AB  - Currently, pain assessment using electroencephalogram signals and machine learning methods in clinical studies is of great importance, especially for those who cannot express their pain. Since newborns are among the high-risk group and always experience pain at the beginning of birth, in this research, the severity of newborns has been investigated and evaluated. Other studies related to the annoyance of newborns have used the EEG signal of newborns alone; therefore, in this study, the intensity of newborn pain was measured using the electroencephalogram signal of 107 infants who were stimulated by the heel lance in three levels: no pain, low pain and moderate pain were recorded as a single trial and evaluated. The support vector machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Ensemble bagging classifiers were trained using the K-fold cross-validation method and features of the brain's time-frequency domain. The results were obtained with accuracies of 72.8 +/- 2, 84.4 +/- 1.3 and 82.9 +/- 1.6%, respectively. Also, in examining the problem of distinguishing pain and no pain, the electroencephalogram signal of 74 infants was evaluated, and similar to the three-class mode, with the 10-fold validation method, we reached the highest accuracy of 100% in Bagging classifier and 98.6 +/- 0.1 accuracy in KNN and SVM classifiers.

AB  - Quantitative measurement of pain using the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has received much attention, recently. Because of the subjective nature of pain, brain network complexities, dynamic interactions of neural processes, and multi-dimensionality of pain perception mechanisms in the brain, pain EEG data processing is associated with complexity and high computational cost. This study aims to propose a new method for selecting efficient EEG channels to determine the area of the scalp that contains the most information about brain activity during acute pain in neonates. Also, selecting relevant channels in pain assessment reduces computational costs. In this study, a new channel selection approach is proposed, which is a combination of filter and wrapper methods. A new pseudo-sequential forward feature selection (pseudo-SFFS) method is proposed by introducing an accuracy threshold to determine the end of the iteration. In this way, the iteration number of SFFS is reduced, and the computational cost is therefore mitigated. We used wavelet transform to extract features. In features selection step, we applied the T-test to the features. Then we selected the effective channels based on the output of the applied pseudo-SFFS algorithm into support vector machine, decision tree, and Gaussian Naive Bayesian classifiers. Using the proposed method two channels of the sensorimotor cortex including Cz and C4 channels have been selected from 18 EEG channels for pain stimulation through the left heel of neonates. The results show that most of the acute pain information of neonates is related to the delta and theta frequency bands. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025.
